A simple netstat GUI written in Swift/SwiftUI, aiming to at some point recreate similar functionality to [currPorts](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/cports.html) for Mac users. It is pretty much a work in progress and in very early development. It's a leisure project, for the purpose of getting to know the quirks of developing in XCode using Swift/SwiftUI, so it's probably going to have bugs and errors.
